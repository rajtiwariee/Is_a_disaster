st.write("Welcome to the Disaster Prediction App, a tool designed to predict whether a given text indicates a disaster or not. This app utilizes a pre-trained text classification model, enabling quick and accurate predictions.")
st.write("Whether you want to assess social media posts, news articles, or any text data for potential disaster-related content, this app is here to assist you.")

st.markdown("### How It Works")
st.write("1. Enter the text you'd like to analyze into the input box.")
st.write("2. Click the 'Predict' button.")
st.write("3. The app will evaluate the text and provide a prediction as well as the prediction probability.")

st.markdown("### Model Details")
st.write("The app employs a pre-trained deep learning model that has been fine-tuned to classify text as either indicating a disaster or not. It is based on a neural network architecture and was trained on a diverse dataset of text examples.")

st.markdown("### Technology Stack")
st.write("This app is powered by Streamlit for the user interface and TensorFlow for the machine learning model. Streamlit offers a simple yet powerful way to create web apps, while TensorFlow is used for the text classification task.")

st.markdown("### Disclaimer")
st.write("The predictions made by this app are based on the patterns and information available in the training data. While it can be a valuable tool, please note that it may not be infallible and should be used in conjunction with human judgment for critical decisions.")


st.markdown("### References")
st.write("The underlying model and techniques used in this app may be based on research and resources from the following:")
