## Overview
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) text classification task designed to identify whether a given tweet is related to a disaster or not. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets into two categories: "Disaster-Related" and "Not Disaster-Related."

## Project Description
X, previously Twitter is a valuable source of information during emergency situations, but it's often challenging to distinguish genuine disaster-related tweets from non-relevant ones. This project aims to build a robust text classification model that can automate this process, aiding in disaster response and crisis management.

## Data
The project uses a labeled dataset consisting of tweets collected from Twitter. The dataset is split into two categories: "Disaster-Related" and "Not Disaster-Related." You can obtain the dataset by [insert source or link here]. The data includes text tweets and their corresponding labels.
